# Winter Project 2019 #1 (PONG)
Recreation of the classic game Pong using Python and the pygame library

The Winter Project is a personal idealization in which I use my free time to develop a project that I am interested. The Winter edition happens in August and might have more than one project.
* Currently this project is in an advanced state, but not finished at all and is passive to change in the future.

## Disclaimer
This project was developed with pygame. If don't have it installed in your computer and already have Pyhton, just download it using the command line: 
```
pip install pygame
```
